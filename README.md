<p>
The Navigation Bar contains three links. The first link is the "About Us" link. This link brings you straight to the About Us section of the website. The middle link on the navigation bar brings you to the "Sign Up" sevtion of the website. This is the most important section of the website. Their is a sign up form provided in this section. The final link on the right of the Navigation bar is the "Contact Us" link. This link brings you to the footer where you will find all the necessary contact details. I chose not to use a home link in the navigation bar because I thought it was unnecessary for such a small website. Also the logo brings you to the home page if needed.
